## My Process

After writing the markup, this was mostly just using my eyes to approximate the dimensions, paddings, margins, etc. and then using the provided parameters and specified colors & fonts to finish out the styling. Flexbox was used to simplify the positioning and then other tweaks were made to get the final look.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- VS Code

### What I learned

I feel I got more practice with Flexbox as well as using custom fonts, which I hadn't really been using in my previous learning projects and bootcamps, primarily because they relied a lot on frameworks like Bootstrap.

### Continued development

I'm looking to continue getting more practice with CSS and Flexbox as I feel other self-started projects I'm working on for my portfolio could use better layout and responsiveness.
